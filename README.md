### Vision
The project is an assessment of using machine learning techniques on the optimization of resistance surfaces.

In biology, using computational approaches for the problems of resistance surfaces is relatively new, so while there has been important work done in this area, there is still much space for improvement and assessment.

This project addresses the issue from the computational perspective, looking at what has been already implemented to approach the problem and what may be effective to implement in the future.

The specific focus of the biological question focuses on deer populations and movement between different populations, and the computational focus is mainly around Genetic Algorithms.

### Code Modules
The genetic algorithm code is in the GA folder. The code is in the GA Jupyter Notebook. The data_for_compare.rmd (R markdown) file walks through how to move the data out of RStudio for use in algorithms implemented in other languages. The small simulated datasets are in the GA/data folder.
