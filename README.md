### Application Domain

I plan to focus on a biology question regarding deer population and what divides different groups of deer. Professor Miller of the biology department has been working on this topic already. When physical barriers (such as highways) are present in an environment, they may cause division into two separate populations. The division prevents mixing and interbreeding. This leads to genetic differences between the populations, which can be examined through sampling.

Until recently, the system for identifying the physical barriers has been based on seeing which barriers coorelate with the differences in the population and suggesting that that barrier may be the dividing line. Professor Miller is examining the barriers more statistically and systematically.

### AI Technology

Professor Miller has been using genetic algorithms to approach this problem, so I will be looking more into how the genetic algorithms work and how they can best be used for this case.

My project will involve examining how genetic algorithms work and how they can best be applied the the deer population question. I plan to start by learning about genetic algorithms in general, then look at the specifics of what he has done with them, and then move into how to improve the application.

After meeting again with Professor Miller, I can give a more thorough description of what the project will involve, but it is essentially using data about deer populations with genetic algorithms.
