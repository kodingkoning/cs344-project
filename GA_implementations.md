### Implementation 1: scikit-learn

The default sklearn package does not include genetic algorithms. However, other have implemented sklearn GA. See:
- https://github.com/manuel-calzolari/sklearn-genetic
- Many implementation tutorials. GA does not seem difficult to implement and there are many implementations available.
- I have not found a stard implementation so far.

### Implementation 2: MatLab

Available in the Global Optimization Toolbox

### Implementation 3: R

An available GA library: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GA/vignettes/GA.html

More important to find out what Professor Miller is already using.
