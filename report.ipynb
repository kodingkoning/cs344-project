    "## Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is an assessment of using machine learning techniques on the optimization of resistance surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In biology, using computational approaches for the problems of resistance surfaces is relatively new, so while there has been important work done in this area, there is still much space for improvement and assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses the issue from the computational perspective, looking at what has been already implemented to approach the problem and what may be effective to implement in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific focus of the biological question focuses on deer populations and movement between different populations, and the computational focus is mainly around Genetic Algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Domain\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of optimizing resistance surfaces is to find the major barriers between populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Miller's research focuses on deer populations and the barriers that separate them. When physical barriers (such as highways or rivers) are present in an environment, they may cause division into two separate populations. The division prevents mixing and interbreeding. This leads to genetic differences between the populations, which can be examined through sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, before introducing computational methods, biologists would look at maps of deer populations and see what the major differences were the aligned with the major differences between populations. For example, they might notice that a river or road ran across the landscape and would logically divide the populations. They may also look at attributes like elevation or locations of cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until recently when computational approaches were introduced, the system for identifying the physical barriers has been based on seeing which barriers coorelate with the differences in the population and suggesting that that barrier may be the dividing line. Professor Miller is examining the barriers more statistically and systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "My work includes evaluating the effectiveness of genetic algorithms for this application and comparing it to the potential behavior of other AI algorithms, including Simulated Annealing and Convolutional Neural Networks.\n",
    "TODO: make sure that I actually address SA and CNN if I say I will\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Miller's work has been using genetic algorithms to approach this problem, so I will be looking more into how the genetic algorithms work and how they can best be used for this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Genetic Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms are a machine learning technique that imitate the process of natural selection. This is one of the reasons it is so popular with biologists. The terminology matches that of evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most similar AI approach that we disucussed in class is simulated annealing. Both GA and SA use the selection of random changes for each iteration, requiring improvements increasingly often through the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major pieces of GA are initialization, selection, genetic operators, heuristics, and termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In intialization, a population hundreds or thousands of possible solutions is created. These are typically randomized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In selection, a part of the population is selected to \"breed\" and create a new generation. A fitness function measures the fitness of each solution so that it is more likely for fit solutions to be selected. The fitness function can be dificult to define, so it may also be a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the genetic operators step, the selected solutions form the new generations using crossover and mutation. As in biology, two parent solutions combine to form a child solution. Crossover works by combining aspects of each of the parents into a new solution, and mutation works by making random changes to a potential solution. Mutation is important because it keeps diversity within the population. Other genetic operators are possible as well, but crossover and mutation are the most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristics can affect the genetic operations processes in order to make the algorithm more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of forming more generations is repeated until it reaches a termination condition. This can include reaching a maximum number of generations or plateauing as assessed by the fitness function.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Background information from Wikipedia article on Genetic Algorithms)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning for Theoretical Foundation Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Existing Work\n",
    "Professor Miller and other biology researchers have been working with Genetic Algorithms on problems addressing resistance surfaces. Peterman from Ohio State, has published ResistanceGA which is an R package specficially designed for this purpose.\n",
    "TODO: source better\n",
    "\n",
    "Biologists appreciate genetic algorithms because of their connections with the language and concepts of biology. Genetic algorithms are conceptually easy for them to understand because they are already familiar with both the principles and terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "R tends to be the programming language that biologists are most familiar with because of its role in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, genetic algorithms are known to be slow. If we can achieve similar results with a faster algorithm, that would be helpful. With Miller's deer dataset, it takes 3-5 days to run the genetic algorithm. Even with a small simulated dataset, it takes multiple hours to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In my project, I have used and examined the running of ResistanceGA using simulated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to use simulated data because of time constraints. With the acutal data, running it will take 3-5 days. With the smaller, simulated dataset, it only takes a couple of hours to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create the simulated dataset, the package creates a \"truth\" map and then samples from there. Then, it it uses the genetic algorithms with the sampled data. As you can see in the results, the truth and optimized result graphs match exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook with these results is located at GA.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulated Annealing may be a good fit because of its similarities with genetic algorithms but better speed. It has many shared properties in terms of the system it uses, but key differences that will affect both its effectiveness and its speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would propose using a multiple-start version of simulated annealing. This approach maintains the helpful aspects of GA while also speeding up the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that the resistance values work with the effective distances makes sense for simulated annelaing and its incremental changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is even possible that SA could achieve better results than GA. SA has more freedom in \n",
    "\n",
    "While hill climbing is even faster than simulated annealing, I would expect to find local maxima in this sort of problem. In real rather than simulated data, surface attributes such as traffic volume and city categorization will be highly correlated. The way that this would be reflected in the weights of the different landscape attributes would lead to local maxima, making simulated annealing a better option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks seem like they may be a good fit because the data is a set of images, which seems to connect well with CNNs. However, while they intially sounded promising because of the similarites with data as images, there are critically differences. As we discussed in class, CNNs work very well for image recognition and categorization. In this problem with deer populations, we are looking for weights on different aspects of the environment. The way the data is considered is also significantly different. In an image recognition problem, there are many images and each image is a datapoint. In this problem, the dataset is not necessarily smaller, but there are fewer images. Instead, each piece of the image is a datapoint giving information about the cooresponding landscape. Because of these fundamental differences, Neural Networks cannot necessarily be considered ineffective, but CNNs can be ruled out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect to speed it up will be to use parellization. It is possible that the GA will still be more effective than the alternatives. In this case, a combination of patience and increased computing power will offer more value than an alternative algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that the AI tools are being used is focused on describing the data present, rather than making predictions about how it generalizes to a broader population. It differs from the algorithms that we are looking at in CS 344, which may present a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendation is to further explore the possibilities in simulated annealing. I believe the ResistanceGA package could provide value to a project using an alternative algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first step I would take would be to consider whether the portion of ResistanceGA that uses the genetic algorithm could be adapted to use simulated annealing instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulated annealing algorithm would still need to create \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "This exporation has implications for the field of biology because...\n",
    "\n",
    "Using machine learning in the area of resistance surfaces can lead to stronger results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human contributions to the environment are some of the factors in consideration. Knowing how human modifications to the landscape are changing the way different populations of animals relate is key for issues regarding conservation and spread of disease. The newer computational approach to the issue of resistance surfaces means that the effects of different aspects of the landscapes can now be statistically compared."
